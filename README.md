# DNASeqClassifier

This miniproject is to utilize two existing DL framework TensorFlow and Nervana Neon to classify the [Molecular Biology (Splice-junction Gene Sequences) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+%28Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences%29).

Considerations when building up the model and the steps of codes are introduced below. 

## Neural network model selection

Feed-forward neural network is selected vs RNN, since the length of input sample is constant.

1. DNN
2. CNN
INFO:tensorflow:Saving dict for global step 31001: accuracy = 0.948276, global_step = 31001, loss = 0.146794


## Data preprocessing and dataset split
1. Data filter/clean-up
2. One hot encoder
3. Training/test split

## Hyperparameter selection
1. Learning rate
2. Number of hidden layers
3. Node in each layer
4. Regularzation
5. Activation function 
6. Optimizor 
7. Mini-batch size
8. Loss function
