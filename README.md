# DNASeqClassifier

This miniproject is to utilize two existing DL framework TensorFlow and Nervana Neon to classify the [Molecular Biology (Splice-junction Gene Sequences) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+%28Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences%29).

Considerations when building up the model and the steps of codes are introduced below. 

## Neural network model selection

Feed-forward neural network is selected vs RNN, since the length of input sample is constant.

1. DNN
2. CNN

## Data preprocessing and dataset split
1. Data filter/clean-up
2. One hot ..
3. Training/test split

## Hyperparameter selection
1. Learning rate selection

2. Number of hidden layers

3. Activation function selection
